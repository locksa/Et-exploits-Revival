# Et-exploits-legacy
The old et exploits (Deleted) were saved by me, so I published them again. (Yes this works at school) Link to the code: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ESfvWx0yTiz6DpT7_W5z0xf9BBQNZ5sfyTpAjTeImxw/edit#slide=id.p
If you are the owner of et exploits and would like this taken down, feel free to contact me about it, and I will.
